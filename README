/* Readme for ptr11c13.                                                  *
*  Ptr11c13 is a demo program to illustrate the use of pointers in       *
*  implementing a copy string function.                                  *
*                                                                        *
*  Two arrays, the text to copy and an empty buffer that will receive.   *
*                                                                        *
*  Interesting point, pointers are used to represent the arrays,         *
*  and the pointers are incremented in parallel to effect the transfer.  *
*                                                                        *
